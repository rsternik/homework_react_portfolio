                I have solved many issues in my career, those with errors information and without.</p>
            <p>I'm now working towards becoming
                a QA Analyst / debugger and I am currently enrolled in the UW Coding bootcamp. Coding has introduced me
                to a new level of challenges when solving problems. I won't be bored for awhile. Please take a look
